## Macro vs Micro Perspective

- Macro is at the community, county, state, and national level - community health, population health, national health
- Micro is at the individual level (person, patient, professional, provider)

When we talk about quality of care or quality of life, we need to differentiate between individual and group. 
In the context of public health, the focus is on group and quality is typically measured in terms of rate or ratio which is 
also risk adjusted.

This course is focused on macro level.
