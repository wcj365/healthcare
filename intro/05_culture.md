### 5.1 What is Culture

- "the way of life, especially the general customs and beliefs, of a particular group of people at a particular time" - Cambridge Dictionary
- "the customary beliefs, social forms, and material traits of a racial, religious, or social group.
also : the characteristic features of everyday existence (such as diversions or a way of life) shared by people in a place or time" - Merriam Webster
- "Simply said, culture is how you were raised. It developed while you grew up. With a computer metaphor, culture is the software of our minds. We need shared software in order to communicate. So culture is about what we share with those around us. In action in social life, culture constitutes the unwritten rules of the social game." - Hofstede.
