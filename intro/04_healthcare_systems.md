## 4. Healthcare Systems and Health Disparity

### 4.1 The Quad-Function Model of Healthcare Delivery System

- Finance
- Insurance
- Delivery
- Payment

### 4.2 HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS OF OTHER COUNTRIES  

Three models of national systems:
1. National health insurance (NHI)
    - A general tax-supported national health care program in which services are financed by the government but are rendered by private providers (e.g., Canada).
2. National health system (NHS)
    - A general tax-supported national health care program in which the government finances and also own and operates the service infrastructure (e.g., Great Britain).
3. Socialized health insurance (SHI)
    - Health care is financed through government-mandated contributions by employers and employees. Health care is delivered by private providers. Government manage the overal healthcare delivery via tight mandates and controls (e.g., Germany). 	
    
### 4.3 Define Health Disparity
 
> Health disparities are preventable differences in the burden of disease, injury, violence, or opportunities to achieve optimal health that are experienced by socially 
> disadvantaged populations. Populations can be defined by factors such as race or ethnicity, gender, education or income, disability, geographic location (e.g., rural or 
> urban), or sexual orientation. Health disparities are inequitable and are directly related to the historical and current unequal distribution of social, political, economic, 
> and environmental resources. - CDC
